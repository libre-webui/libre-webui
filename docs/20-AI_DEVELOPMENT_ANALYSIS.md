# Use a faster model
export CHANGELOG_AI_MODEL=llama3.2:3b

# Or increase timeout
export OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=60000
```

**🤖 "Model not found"**
```bash
# Install the recommended models
ollama pull llama3.2:3b      # Fast and reliable
ollama pull llama3.1:latest  # Balanced performance

# Or use an available model
ollama list
export CHANGELOG_AI_MODEL=your-available-model
```
