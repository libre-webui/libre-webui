- **24B parameters** = ~12GB memory, specialized excellence
- **32B parameters** = ~16GB memory, advanced reasoning capabilities
- **70B+ parameters** = 32GB+ memory, state-of-the-art performance

## üöÄ Getting Started with Models

### Step 1: Download Your First Model
1. Go to the **Models** section in the sidebar
2. Click "Pull Model" 
3. Enter a model name like `gemma3:4b`
4. Wait for the download to complete

### Step 2: Start Chatting
1. Go back to the **Chat** section
2. You'll see your model is now available
3. Type a message and press Enter
4. Watch the AI respond in real-time!

### Step 3: Try Advanced Features
- **Upload an image** (with vision models like `qwen2.5vl:32b`)
- **Adjust settings** like creativity and response length
- **Create custom prompts** to change the AI's behavior

## üé® Creative Use Cases

### Writing Assistant
```
"Help me write a professional email to..."
"Proofread this document and suggest improvements"
"Create a story outline about..."
```

### Learning & Research
```
"Explain quantum physics in simple terms"
"What are the pros and cons of..."
"Help me understand this concept by giving examples"
```

### Programming Helper (with devstral:24b)
```
"Create a complete web application with authentication"
"Debug this complex codebase and suggest improvements"
"Build an autonomous coding agent for this project"
```

### Image Analysis (with qwen2.5vl:32b)
```
"What's in this image and what does it mean?"
"Extract all text from this document accurately"
"Analyze this complex chart and provide insights"
```

### Advanced Reasoning (with deepseek-r1:32b)
```
"Think through this complex problem step by step"
"What are the hidden implications of this decision?"
"Solve this multi-step logical puzzle"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features

### Custom System Prompts
Change how the AI behaves by setting a system prompt:
```
"You are a helpful programming tutor. Always explain concepts step by step."
"You are a creative writing assistant. Help me brainstorm ideas."
"You are a professional editor. Focus on clarity and grammar."
```

### Structured Outputs
Ask for responses in specific formats:
```
"List the pros and cons in JSON format"
"Give me a summary with bullet points"
"Create a table comparing these options"
```

### Temperature & Creativity
- **Low temperature (0.1-0.3)**: Focused, consistent responses
- **Medium temperature (0.5-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and coherence  
- **High temperature (0.8-1.0)**: More creative and varied responses

## üîç Model Capabilities Reference

| Model Type | Best For | Memory Needed | Speed |
|------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Compact Efficiency** | Quick tasks, edge devices | 1-3GB | Ultra-Fast |
| **Single-GPU Champions** | Balanced performance, daily use | 3-8GB | Fast |
| **Reasoning Specialists** | Complex thinking, problem-solving | 12-16GB | Medium |
| **Vision-Language** | Image analysis, multimodal tasks | 8-32GB | Medium |
| **Coding Agents** | Advanced programming, debugging | 12-24GB | Medium |
| **State-of-the-Art** | Maximum capability, research | 32GB+ | Slower |

## üí° Tips for Better Results

### Writing Better Prompts
- **Be specific**: "Write a 200-word summary" vs "Summarize this"
- **Give context**: "I'm a beginner" or "I'm an expert in..."
- **Ask for examples**: "Show me examples of..."
- **Specify format**: "Give me a numbered list" or "Explain step by step"

### Managing Performance
- **Use smaller models** for simple tasks to save memory
- **Switch models** based on your current task
- **Monitor memory usage** in the Models section
- **Keep frequently used models loaded** for faster responses

### Privacy & Security
‚úÖ **Your data never leaves your computer**
‚úÖ **No internet connection required** (after downloading models)
‚úÖ **Full control over your conversations**
‚úÖ **No tracking or data collection**

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Model won't download?**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you have enough disk space
- Try a smaller model first

**Responses are slow?**
- Try a smaller model (1B or 3B parameters)
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Check if multiple models are loaded

**AI gives strange responses?**
- Adjust the temperature setting
- Try rephrasing your question
- Use a different model for your task
