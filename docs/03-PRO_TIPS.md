3. Switch models: `llama3.2:3b` for speed, `llama3.3:70b` for complex work

### **Business Productivity**
1. Email assistant setup:
   ```
   You are a professional communication assistant. Help me write clear business communications.
   ```
2. Document processing with `qwen2.5vl:32b` for images
3. Generate summaries and action items

### **Programming Helper**
1. Use `devstral:24b` for advanced coding
2. Upload code screenshots for analysis
3. Get debugging help and code reviews

### **Research & Analysis**
1. Use fast models for exploration
2. Switch to larger models for deep analysis
3. Upload charts/graphs for visual analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features Mastery

### üñºÔ∏è **Multimodal Excellence**
**Best Practices for Image Analysis:**

- **Upload Quality:** Use clear, high-resolution images
- **Context Matters:** Provide background information
- **Specific Questions:** Ask focused questions about image content
- **Multiple Angles:** Upload several images of the same subject

**Pro Image Workflow:**
1. Upload image(s) - up to 5 per message
2. Start with broad questions: "What do you see in this image?"
3. Follow up with specific questions: "What's the text in the top-right corner?"
4. Use for document OCR, chart analysis, and visual problem-solving

### üìä **Structured Output Mastery**
**Advanced JSON Schema Techniques:**

**Custom Analysis Template:**
```json
{
  "summary": "Brief overview",
  "key_points": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"],
  "recommendations": ["Action 1", "Action 2"],
  "confidence_level": "High/Medium/Low",
  "next_steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2"]
}
```

**Data Extraction Template:**
```json
{
  "entities": {
    "people": ["Name 1", "Name 2"],
    "organizations": ["Org 1", "Org 2"],
    "dates": ["2024-01-01"],
    "locations": ["City, Country"]
  },
  "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral",
  "topics": ["Topic 1", "Topic 2"]
}
```

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
**Memory Management:**
- Monitor running models in the Models section
- Use smaller models for simple tasks
- Load larger models only when needed
- Close unused models to free memory

**Speed Optimization:**
- Keep frequently used models loaded
- Use appropriate model sizes for tasks
- Batch similar questions together
- Utilize streaming for long responses

**Quality Optimization:**
